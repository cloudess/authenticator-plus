      Privacy Policy
      Authenticator is a client application designed for generating Time-based One Time use Passwords (TOTP) for online services that enable 2-factor authentication. Your information is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to any third parties. The codes generated by this application meet all TOTP and RFC 3548 base32 standards for generating access codes.

      Information Collected
      In the event of an application error, crash, or problem, we may ask you to send an email message with crash information. Such an email may contain personally identifiable information, and it is your choice whether to send such a message. While using the app, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and help you resolve support or assistance with the app. This will happen through a prompt asking for feedback, allowing you to send an e-mail message, and is not automatic. In order to provide you with a better experience, to improve the application and its services, we may share non-identifying information (such as the current page within the application being viewed) to serve you better and analyze and understand how the app is used. There are application preferences that may enable or turn off such functionality.

      Contacting the Author
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please send an email to authenticator@mbmccormick.com.
