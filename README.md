Authenticator is a simple security tool that generates a security code for accounts that require 2-Step Verification. Authenticator supports any 30-second Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm, such as Google Authenticator. You can add accounts to Authenticator by manually entering your RFC 3548 base32 key string or by scanning a QR code.
